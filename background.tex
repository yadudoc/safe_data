\section{Background and Motivation} \label{sec:background}

There are two major camps that try to attempt to solve the problem of computing on sensitive
datasets without disclosing the underlying sensitive micro-data. Data enclaves attempt to
provide a secure environment to apply computation over sensitive data with security enforced
via controlling what enters and exits the system often via human oversight. Formal privacy
techniques on the other hand state privacy assumptions and guarantees and the privacy loss
from analyses are formally defined.

Formal privacy techniques such as homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation and
other cryptographic solutions for protecting private data often comes at heavy computational
overheads \cite{naehrig2011can}. Work on database based solutions \cite{popa2011cryptdb}
demonstrates the need for matching the privacy protecting methods to the analysis in question
to reduce overheads. The majority of the work in this area is focussed on the security of
numerical data, while the data we are dealing with is mostly large volumes of textual data.
Recent work \cite{kepner2014computing} on applying privacy techniques to securely compute
mathematical operation at big data scales incur a 2x overhead.

Computing systems in some of the most critical and sensitive areas such as military, avionics,
nuclear are protected from intrusion by physical isolation\cite{byres2013air}, \cite{ross2013security}.
The US census bureau to this day has several enclaves that host sensitive microdata accessible
only on site \cite{rdc_uscensus}. With physical proximity being a limiting factor, data enclaves
evolved to support network access via encrypted channels and limited IO bandwidths \cite{lane2008using}, \cite{grossman2016toward}.
Accessibility in this case comes at the cost of increased attack surface.

On Cloud Kotta we currently archive over 10TB of compressed text data and in the past year
alone, analyses on the datasets consumed over 0.25M core hours. With a cloud hosted system
such as our

\yadu{Kyle: We need a review that expands on the following}

Current limitation of data-enclaves:
The need for switching to Cloud
      Democratization - Anyone can have an enclave
      Cost effective - Demise of the campus cluster model
      Legal constraints?

 How to secure the outputs that are generated ?

 Limitations of formal methods:

 Show the current scale of compute (0.25M core hours last year). Any system that adds to this overhead can
 be significantly expensive.

 Homomorphic encryption overheads are too high.


 Discuss the 3 flavors of data:
 1) Public: no sensitive information and no protection required
 2) Confidential: contains private information and legal/contractual obligation to control access and usage.
 3) Regulated: contains sensitive data that can be widely damaging if disclosed. Usually controlled by govt.
    regulations. Eg HIPAA, SSNs etc


Cloud Kotta is a data-enclave designed to enable computation over sensitive data-sets
in a cost effective and secure manner. In prior work we've shown that Cloud Kotta offers
a scalable solution to match the compute needs of a distributed research network.
This model involved two classes of users: 1) the administrators who take on the role of managing
users, approving privileges and handling the transfer of data onto the data stores. 2) the analysts
who perform the role of developing analytical pipelines and running analyses on the data-sets.

The workflow of an analyst on Cloud Kotta involves requesting access to a data-set, submitting analyses
tasks via the various interfaces to interrogate the data and tune the analyses until results are generated.
These results are available by requesting the UUID4 url of the submitted task and not tied to any user.
This was designed to allow for sharing of analyses codes and results, but this introduces the risk
of unintended, unapproved access to the generated results. More importantly since there is no disclosure
controls on the results generated, any sensitive data that makes it to the results can be exported.
