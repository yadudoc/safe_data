\section{Introduction}


% Describe data science and a lab

Today, researchers are increasingly dependent on the ability to store, manage and analyze vast amounts of
data. The data-sets come in varying size, structure and sensitivity. 
In a typical research lab, collaborators from multiple institutions often share data and techniques
for analyzing the data. Given the sensitivity of data, the security of the data is a primary concern.

% Describe data and security concerns

Labs engaged in data-science often use a wide range of data-sets. While many data-sets are public the most
valuable ones are often considered private due to legal or contractual obligations under which the data
is shared, or even governmental regulations due to the nature of the data. The limited and proprietary nature
of the data further increases the perceived value to the researcher. However this also adds the burden of
ensuring the security of the data to the researchers.

% Ability to compute effectively and securely.

Here are some critical problems researchers face in this space:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data-sets are large, posing problems for storage, compute and cost.
\item Varying degrees of sensitivity in data-sets require configurable security
\item Share access, analyses across individuals and groups.
\end{itemize}
